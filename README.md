# Soup Core

## About
This is an unfinished SoupPvP plugin I worked on in the past. It's designed to be used with 1.8, but it should work with all versions.

## Features
This plugin uses a MySQL database to store player information, including kills, deaths, killstreak (and killstreak records), etc.

Features considered for addition: Vault economy integration, Scoreboard display.
Don't count on these being added, it's probably more reliable to add them yourselves as the need for this project was abandoned, so I decided to make the WIP public

## Usage
It should work as-is, but you're always welcome to fork it and add whatever features you like. Using it as-is, it will keep track of kills, deaths, and killstreaks and allow for instant soup eating, which heals 3.5 hearts.
