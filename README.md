# Soup Core

## About
This is an unfinished SoupPvP plugin I worked on in the past. It's designed to be used with 1.8, but it should work with all versions.

## Features
This plugin uses a MongoDB database to store player information, including kills, deaths, killstreak (and killstreak records), etc.

Features considered for addition: Vault economy integration, Scoreboard display
These will most likely be added, assuming I can find time and motivation to implement them.

## Usage
It should work as-is, but you're always welcome to fork it and add whatever features you like. Using it as it is, it will keep track of kills, deaths, and killstreaks and allow for instant soup eating, which heals 3.5 hearts.
